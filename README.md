STARFIGHTER
===========

This is 2-D battleship style game that was made using Ruby with Gosu. For the moment, the game is quite straighforward but I plan to turn it into more sophisticated, arcade-style project in the future.

Instructions
-------------

You need Gosu installed, installation instruction can be found on the [Gosu Wiki](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Linux). I've have difficulties using Gosu with Ruby 2.0 and up but it works great with Ruby 1.9 I use RVM to manage ruby dependencies.

Once you have Gosu installed, feel free to clone the repository. You can then start the game with the command:

ruby Main.rb
