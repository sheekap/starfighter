STARFIGHTER
===========

This game was adapted from the [Starfighter Ruby/Gosu tutorial](https://github.com/masonhale/Starfighter-Gosu-Tutorial) by [masonhale](https://github.com/masonhale).
I've made some small changes and updated the code a bit since the tutorial is quite old now. More changes will come in future to make the game more sophisticated.

Instructions
-------------

You need Gosu installed, installation instruction can be found on the [Gosu Wiki](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Linux). I've have difficulties using Gosu with Ruby 2.0 and up but it works great with Ruby 1.9 I use RVM to manage ruby dependencies.

Once you have Gosu installed, feel free to clone the repository. You can then start the game with the command:

ruby Main.rb
